## Some explanations how the site should be maintained

Hey **Waley**.

This is a short documentation of the site and its functionality.

https://official-theorie-home.myshopify.com/

The shop now in development mode, and can be turned into paid plan and get real payments.

## Homepage             

All content in homepage is easily controlled from shopify dashboard, each section can be drag and drag, change order, disable or enable.

Check the following video to see the options in action

## FAQ page

Faq page is using different template with name page.faq.liquid, we can easily edit this page from dashboard as well.

We should go into theme customization section

[faq page admin settings](https://official-theorie-home.myshopify.com/admin/themes/12474187818/editor#/pages/frequently-asked-questions)

And here on left side you will see options to add group questions and answers and group them.

Check the following video to see how tow work with faq page.

## Product page.

In product page all is controlled from default Shopify dashboard.

The only things where we will use metafields are the botttom 3 boxes. We will use metafields to load 3 additional field in product edit dashboard and put our content there, and one field for short description

If you have not installed custom metafielsd chrome extension, then follow this links to install it

[Install Metafields extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-fields-for-shopify/alfplfpobekffinigeidgmmfjollghln?hl=en-GB){:target="_blank"}

Once you installed, and go into product page, you can enable custom fields and see additional fields where you can store values for subtitle and for buttom 3 columns.

As the custom fields don't have visual editor, you can use the following tool from my site to generate html and put it into custom fields.

And then follow this video where I am showing how to work with it.

## Collection page

In collection page, as you said we need to have image banner with text and button. We will use default options for banner, to not use metafields, so

1. the collection image will be banner image.
2. ‎collection title will be banner title
3. ‎and collection description will be banner description.
4. And button will be "a" (link) in collection description.

Check the following video where I am showing all these.
