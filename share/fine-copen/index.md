## Short explanation about some functionality of the site.

### Tabs

For tabs we use metafields, it is clean method to have unique data for each product and it is easier to maintain, as we have additional fields for inserting info, for details, size and for shipping.

For first tab the default description is being loaded, for the other tabs we load data from metafields.

And it becomes into this kind of Tabs

if none of metafields are filled then we show only description without tabs, like This

To enable metafields we should install free chrome extension.

If you have not installed custom metafielsd chrome extension, then follow this links to install it

[Install Metafields extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-fields-for-shopify/alfplfpobekffinigeidgmmfjollghln?hl=en-GB){:target="_blank"}

Once you installed, and go into product page, you can enable custom fields and see additional fields where you can store values for tabs.

As the custom fields don't have visual editor, you can use the following tool from my site to generate html and put it into custom fields.

And then follow this video where I am showing how to work with it.
