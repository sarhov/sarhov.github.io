## Some explanations how the site should be maintained

----

#### Home page

I have already put the placeholder banners with preferred sizes for them, the designer can create those banner using that sizes.

I need your access token for instagram to make instagram section work, you can generate your access token using the following page:

#### About navigation

Also I am not sure who will update the navigation, there are ready for megamenu just need the list of menu items to insert them into navigation.

For mega menu we use navigation section of the site, as now shopify support nested menus we will use it to have mega menu. For that go into navigation section [admin/menus](https://epostraders-co-uk.myshopify.com/admin/menus/12669812777) in dashboard.

For navigation, as all filtering is being done using tag in shopify, in meganav we can filter the links using tags, I have already 2 examples for this.

### About filtration in collection pages

In Shopify for filtration functionality we use tags, for price, for manufacturer, for condition and so own

And grouping for filtration should be done the following way

- price_$10-$19
- price_$20-$29

- manufacturer_name
- manufacturer_another name

- condition_new
- condition_used

each word before underline is group name, so adding tags the way I have written above, in collection page we will have the following filtration groups

*Price*

*Manufacturer*

*Condition*

#### Products

I have imported some demo products to be able to work on some sections, will be great if we can insert real products, as after it some issues can appear and I can fix them.

Ideally, will be great, if we have the full list of site's collections and products. ))
