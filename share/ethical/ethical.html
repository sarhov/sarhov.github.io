<h2>
	3. Settings for images in inner pages
</h2>
<hr>

<h3>
	At first we will need metafields free app from chrome app store
</h3>
<p>
	Visiti the following link - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-fields-for-shopify/alfplfpobekffinigeidgmmfjollghln">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-fields-for-shopify/alfplfpobekffinigeidgmmfjollghln</a>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	After we install this we can activate additional field for inner pages and put there the value we need, in our case it will be url to the image which will be loaded as banner for each page.
</p>
<p>
	Now we can upload our images into files section and then take their url and past in the fields we now have in dashboard, for this
</p>
<p>

	we go into <strong>settings </strong>&gt;&nbsp; <strong>files </strong>and upload our images<
</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://u.sarhov.com/2r18TOA"">
</p>
<p>

	We now just need to copy the url of the image, go to the page we 
	want this image be as banner, activate metafields and put the url into that field. Check please this videoinstruction where the all steps are shown.
